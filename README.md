Project: Student Scholarship Management System
Tech Stack: Angular, Spring Boot, MySQL, REST APIs

Description:
Designed and developed a full-stack web application to manage student scholarship data using Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot as the backend service layer, with MySQL as the database.
The system enables administrators to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) student records, track scholarship disbursement status, and maintain eligibility criteria details.

Key Responsibilities:
Developed secure and scalable RESTful APIs in Spring Boot to manage student, scholarship, and application data.
Created a responsive, user-friendly interface using Angular, allowing seamless data entry and updates.
Integrated the backend with MySQL, performing data modeling and writing optimized queries for efficient data retrieval and persistence.
Implemented features such as form validation, filter/search functionality, and pagination for large data sets.
Ensured smooth frontend-backend communication using HTTP client services and JSON data exchange.
Conducted unit and integration testing using Postman and Angular testing utilities to ensure reliability.

Outcome:
Successfully built and deployed a modular and maintainable application that streamlined scholarship data management, improved accuracy, and reduced manual workload for administrators.
